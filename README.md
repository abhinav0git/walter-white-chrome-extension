# Chrome Extension: Walter White

## Overview

This Chrome extension… it’s not just some gimmick. It’s a tool. You hit Ctrl + Q, and boom—a sidebar opens. You paste in any job post image, and it extracts the critical info. Fast. Precise. No fluff.

It’s for people who mean business. Job hunters who don’t have time to waste. You want to stay focused? Stay efficient? Then you use this.

Because in this game… you either stay ahead, or you get left behind.

## Features

*   **1:** You take a screenshot. You paste it—just like that. Then you hit “Create Todo.” What happens next? The extension sends it to Gemini. And Gemini… extracts everything that matters. Email. Referral contact. Job description. Onsite or remote—the essentials. Then it builds a sharp, concise todo so you never lose track of an opportunity again.
*   **2:** Every todo you create? It’s all there—fetched and displayed in a clean, chatbot-style interface. Easy. Intuitive. Like it’s reading your mind
*   *(more features are coming. And when they do… you’ll be ready)*
